# WordPress Publishing Feature

## Overview
This feature automatically publishes blog posts to WordPress when they are approved and have a scheduled publish date. It includes manual publishing capability and sends complete blog data to your n8n webhook for WordPress integration.

---

## üéØ **What Was Added**

### 1. **WordPress Publisher Webhook**
- **URL**: `https://n8n.aiautomata.co.za/webhook/blog_post`
- **Purpose**: Receives complete blog post data and publishes to WordPress
- **Location**: Added to Client Settings (table 1061) for each client
- **Fallback**: Environment variable `WEBHOOK_WORDPRESS_PUBLISHER`

### 2. **Featured Image Fields in Blog Posts**
Added to blog post form and data model:
- `featured_image_url` - URL of the featured image
- `featured_image_alt` - Alt text for SEO and accessibility
- Image preview display in edit mode
- Error handling for broken images

### 3. **Auto-Publish Trigger**
Located in: `src/app/api/baserow/[clientId]/blog-posts/[postId]/route.ts`

**Triggers when:**
- Blog post status is changed to `"Approved"` OR `"Published"`
- Blog post has a `scheduled_publish_date` set

**What it does:**
- Automatically calls the WordPress publishing endpoint in the background
- Non-blocking (doesn't fail blog update if publishing fails)
- Logs all actions for debugging

### 4. **Manual Publish Button**
Located on: Blog Post Edit Page (`/dashboard/[clientId]/blog-posts/[postId]`)

**Visibility:**
- Only shows when status = "Approved" OR "Published" AND scheduled_publish_date is set
- Blue button with "Publish to WordPress" text
- Shows loading state "Publishing..." when active

**Features:**
- Manual trigger for WordPress publishing
- Toast notifications for success/error
- Calls same endpoint as auto-publish

### 5. **WordPress Publishing API Endpoint**
File: `src/app/api/blog/publish-to-wordpress/route.ts`

**What it does:**
1. Fetches complete blog post data from Baserow
2. Gets WordPress configuration from Client Settings
3. Retrieves WordPress webhook URL (3-tier fallback)
4. Prepares comprehensive payload
5. Sends to n8n webhook for WordPress publishing

## üîß **Configuration for New Clients**

When creating a new client, the WordPress webhook is automatically:
1. Added to environment variables table (1030)
2. Initialized in Client Settings (1061) with default URL
3. Available in Settings UI for customization

**Default webhook URL**: `https://n8n.aiautomata.co.za/webhook/blog_post`

---

## üìù **Environment Variables**

### **Local Development (.env.local)**
```bash
WEBHOOK_WORDPRESS_PUBLISHER=https://n8n.aiautomata.co.za/webhook/blog_post
```

### **Vercel Production**
Add in Vercel Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables:
```
WEBHOOK_WORDPRESS_PUBLISHER = https://n8n.aiautomata.co.za/webhook/blog_post
```

---

## üîÑ **Webhook Fallback Priority**

The system uses a 3-tier fallback:

1. **Client Settings (table 1061)** - First priority, client-specific
2. **Environment Variable** - Second, `WEBHOOK_WORDPRESS_PUBLISHER`
3. **Hardcoded Default** - Last resort, system-wide default

This ensures the webhook always works even if not configured.

---

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### Issue: "WordPress publisher webhook not configured"
**Solution**: 
- Check Client Settings table (1061) for the webhook URL
- Verify environment variable is set
- Check `getWebhookUrl` function logs

### Issue: Auto-publish not triggering
**Solution**:
- Ensure status is exactly "Approved" or "Published" (case-sensitive)
- Ensure `scheduled_publish_date` is set (not empty)
- Check browser console for trigger logs
- Check API route logs for auto-publish execution

### Issue: Manual publish button not showing
**Solution**:
- Status must be "Approved" or "Published"
- Must have `scheduled_publish_date` set
- Refresh page after saving

### Issue: Payload missing data
**Solution**:
- Check blog post has all fields filled
- Verify featured image URL is valid
- Check WordPress settings are saved
- Review API endpoint logs for data fetching

### Issue: n8n webhook not receiving
**Solution**:
- Test webhook URL in Postman/curl
- Check n8n workflow is active
- Verify webhook URL in settings matches n8n
- Check API response for webhook errors
