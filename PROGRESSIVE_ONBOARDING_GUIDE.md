- ✅ Contact information
- ✅ Business goals
- ✅ Brand colors
- ✅ Onboarding Status: "Complete"

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Step 1 fails with "Already exists"**
**Solution:** Client was partially created. Either:
- Use different company name
- Or delete existing record from table 3232

### **Issue: Step 2-4 fails with "Client ID not found"**
**Solution:** Step 1 didn't complete. Check:
- Browser sessionStorage has `onboardingClientId`
- Table 3232 has the record
- Restart from Step 1

### **Issue: Step 5 times out**
**Solution:** Workspace creation takes >60 seconds. Options:
- **Upgrade to Vercel Pro** for longer timeouts
- Or reduce number of fields created initially
- Or implement background job for field creation

### **Issue: Can't go back to edit previous steps**
**Solution:** Currently, going back doesn't reload saved data. This is intentional for now. If you need to edit, you'd need to:
- Delete the client from table 3232
- Start over

---

## 📝 **Current Limitations**

1. **No Resume Capability (Yet)**
   - If user closes browser mid-onboarding, they start over
   - Future: Could detect partial client and offer to resume

2. **Can't Edit Previous Steps**
   - Back button works, but doesn't reload saved data
   - Future: Load data from API when going back

3. **Step 5 Still Subject to Timeout**
   - On free tier, might fail if >10 seconds
   - Recommendation: Upgrade to Pro or reduce initial fields

---

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

Based on testing results, we can:

1. **If Step 5 times out:**
   - Reduce number of fields created initially
   - Or implement background job for Step 5
   - Or recommend Vercel Pro upgrade

2. **If all works:**
   - Add resume capability
   - Add data loading when going back
   - Add progress persistence across sessions

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

Onboarding is successful when:
- ✅ All 5 steps complete without errors
- ✅ Client Information table (3232) has complete record
- ✅ Client Configurations table (3231) has config
- ✅ Environment Variables table (1030) has credentials
- ✅ Settings tables (1061, 1062) have defaults
- ✅ User lands on functional dashboard
- ✅ All content sections work

**Ready for Testing!** 🚀

Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment, then test the progressive onboarding flow!
